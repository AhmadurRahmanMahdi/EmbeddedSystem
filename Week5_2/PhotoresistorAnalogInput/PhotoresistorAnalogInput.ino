//The photoresistor is an electronic component which resistivity varies according to the amount of light received ( the resistance decreases when exposed to the light ).

//The photoresistor is made of cadmium sulphide tape, a semiconductor.

//When photons hit the tapes, electrons can pass through the semiconductor.

//The main use of the photoresistor is the measurement of the luminous intensity ( camera, detection systems, â€¦ ).
